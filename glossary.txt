Glossary for storage


AHCI - The Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is a technical standard
  defined by Intel that specifies the operation of Serial ATA (SATA) host bus
  adapters in a non-implementation-specific manner.

  The specification describes a system memory structure for computer hardwar
  vendors to exchange data between host system memory and attached storage
  devices.  AHCI gives software developers and hardware designers a standard 
  method for detecting, configuring, and programming SATA/AHCI adapters.  AHCI
  is separate from the SATA 3 Gbit/s standard, although it exposes SATA's
  advanced capabilities (such as hot swapping and native command queuing) such
  that host systems can utilize them.

NAS (Network-attached storage) - A NAS unit is a computer connected
  to a network that provides only file-based data storage services
  to other devices on the network.  Although it may technically be
  possible to run other software on a NAS unit,  it is usually not
  designed to be a general-purpose server.  For example, NAS units
  usually do not have a keyboard or display, and are controlled and
  configured over the network, often using a browser.[4]

  A full-featured operating system is not needed on a NAS device,
  so often a stripped-down operating system is used.  For example,
  FreeNAS or NAS4Free, both open source NAS solutions designed
  for commodity PC hardware, are implemented as a stripped-down
  version of FreeBSD.

  NAS systems contain one or more hard disk drives, often
  arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID.

  NAS uses file-based protocols such as NFS (popular on UNIX
  systems), SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block/Common Internet File
  System) (used with MS Windows systems), AFP (used with Apple
  Macintosh computers), or NCP (used with OES and Novell
  NetWare). NAS units rarely limit clients to a single
  protocol.

UUID - Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is an identifier standard used in
  software construction.  A UUID is simply a 128-bit value.  The meaning of
  each bit is defined by any of several variants.

  For human-readable display, many systems use a canonical format using
  hexadecimal text with inserted hyphen characters.  For example:
    de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013

  The intent of UUIDs is to enable distributed systems to uniquely identify
  information without significant central coordination.  In this context the
  word unique should be taken to mean "practically unique" rather than
  "guaranteed unique".  Since the identifiers have a finite size, it is
  possible for two differing items to share the same identifier.  The
  identifier size and generation process need to be selected so as to make
  this sufficiently improbable in practice.  Anyone can create a UUID and use
  it to identify something with reasonable confidence that the same
  identifier will never be unintentionally created by anyone to identify
  something else.  Information labeled with UUIDs can therefore be later
  combined into a single database without needing to resolve identifier (ID)
  conflicts.

  Adoption of UUIDs is widespread with many computing platforms providing
  support for generating UUIDs and for parsing/generating their textual
  representation.

What Are They?
  1 Bit = Binary Digit
  8 Bits = 1 Byte
  1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte 
  1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte
  1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte 
  1024 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte 
  1024 Terabytes = 1 Petabyte 
  1024 Petabytes = 1 Exabyte
  1024 Exabytes = 1 Zettabyte 
  1024 Zettabytes = 1 Yottabyte 
  1024 Yottabytes = 1 Brontobyte
  1024 Brontobytes = 1 Geopbyte
