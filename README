deduplication.txt
  "In computing, data deduplication is a specialized data compression  technique for 
  eliminating coarse-grained redundant data, typically to improve storage utilization. In the 
  deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be 
  stored, along with references to the unique copy of data. Deduplication is able to reduce 
  the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored."

fuse.txt
  "Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a loadable kernel module for Unix-like computer operating
  systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel
  code. This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module
  provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces."
