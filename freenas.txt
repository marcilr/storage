Crucial MX200 SSD Review (500GB/1TB)
"Based upon the rating on the MX200s' stickers, the max power consumption is
rated for up to 8.5W. In testing we found they were able to stay well under
this value. Max draw was under 5W.  At idle they consumed very little power
at 60 and 65 milliwatts respectfully.  This is very good for those who plan
on putting this SSD in a laptop, Ultrabook, or tablet."

The 'Hidden' Cost of Using ZFS for Your Home NAS

Supermicro 2U SuperChassis 216
These 24x 2.5" SAS3/SATA hard drive chassis rock hard.
Would need to determine the correct power rating for:
1TB Crucial MX200 ($307.77) <===
1TB Crucial MX300 ($249.99)
Given the MX200's use a max of 8.5W then 
24x8.5W = 204W
Hence the 920W would be ample.
