FreeNAS - Hardware recommendations (read this first)
Discussion in 'Hardware' started by cyberjock, Aug 26, 2014.
o Supermicro is mostly the king here and is about the only brand recommended.
o Use ECC RAM since this is the only type of RAM recommended for FreeNAS.
o 8 GB minimum ram for ZFS, the 1 GB per TB.
o IPMI is awesome. You can remotely connect to your server's video and
  keyboard/mouse inputs.  If you don't want to leave a monitor hooked up
  all of the time this *is* something you should get.  Keep in mind that
  adding it after the fact is expensive/impossible so buying a board with
  it built-in is a major win for you.
o Intel NIC are supreme, especially with two of them.  Realteks and many
  other brands are known to not work at all or work very intermittently
  with FreeBSD/FreeNAS so they aren't recommended.
o Multiprocessor really isn't required unless you actually plan to run
  lots of jails, Virtualbox VMs, and the like.  The main reason to consider
  multiprocessor is the extra RAM slots.
o The X9SRH-7F ($420) uses the E5-1600/2600v2 CPUs, up to 512GB of RAM, <===
  has PCI and PCIe 2.0 and 3.0 slots, built-in LSI-2308 SAS 6Gb/sec
  controller, IPMI and dual Intel Gb LAN. If you are looking at this
  category you are going to have to spend some cash.  But, the potential
  wins can be amazing.  If this is for a company that wants performance,
  expandability in the future, and reliability, this is the board for you.
  Likewise if you are that home user that plans to go really big with
  FreeNAS this is the board you should look at.

o The IBM ServeRAID M1015[1], crossflashed to IT mode[2], is probably one of the
  best choices available if you need a bunch of extra SATA/SAS ports.
  It does take an extra ~12 watts however.  Don't buy it new.  They're
  available cheap on eBay all the time.
