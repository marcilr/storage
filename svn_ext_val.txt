# btrfs/   Btrfs (B-tree file system, pronounced as "butter F S",
#          "better F S",[8] "b-tree F S",[10] or simply by spelling it out) is
#          a GPL-licensed copy-on-write file system for Linux. Development
#          began at Oracle Corporation in 2007.

# encfs/   EncFS is a Free (LGPL) FUSE-based cryptographic filesystem.  It
#          transparently encrypts files, using an arbitrary directory as
#          storage for the encrypted files.

#
# ext3/    ext3, or third extended filesystem, is a journaled file system that
#          is commonly used by the Linux kernel.  It is the default file
#          system for many popular Linux distributions, including Debian.
#          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3
#
# ext4/    The ext4 or fourth extended filesystem is a journaling file system
#          for Linux, developed as the successor to ext3.

#
# fuse/    Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is an operating system mechanism for
#          Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users
#          create their own file systems without editing kernel code.  This is
#          achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE
#          module provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.

# gfs/     Google File System - It provides fault tolerance while running on
#          inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate
#          performance to a large number of clients.

# imapfs/  FUSE filesystem that allows you to store files on an IMAP account.

#
# jfs/     JFS - Journaled File System or JFS is a 64-bit journaling filesystem
#          created by IBM.  An implementation for the Linux kernel is
#          available as free software under the terms of the GNU General
#          Public License (GPL).  There are versions for AIX, eComStation,
#          OS/2 and Linux operating systems.  HP-UX has another, different
#          filesystem named JFS that is actually an OEM version of Veritas
#          Software's VxFS.

#
# lessfs/  Lessfs is a high-performance inline data deduplication filesystem
#          written for Linux and is currently licensed under the GNU General
#          Public License version 3. It also supports LZO, QuickLZ and BZip
#          compression (among a couple others), and data encryption.  At the
#          time of this writing, the latest stable version is 1.3.3.1, which
#          can be downloaded from the SourceForge project page:

# msdos/   MS-DOS (acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an
#          operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed
#          by Microsoft.  It was the most commonly used member of the DOS
#          family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for
#          IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s to the
#          mid-1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems
#          offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations
#          of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft
#          Corporation.

#
# nfs/     Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol
#          originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984,[1]  allowing a
#          user on a client computer to access files over a network much like
#          local storage is accessed.  NFS, like many other protocols, builds
#          on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC)
#          system.  The Network File System is an open standard defined in
#          RFCs, allowing anyone to implement the protocol.

# ntfs/    NTFS (New Technology File System[1]) is a proprietary file system
#          developed by Microsoft.[1]
#          NTFS has several technical improvements over FAT and HPFS (High
#          Performance File System), the file systems that it superseded, such
#          as improved support for metadata, and the use of advanced data
#          structures to improve performance, reliability, and disk space
#          utilization, plus additional extensions, such as security access
#          control lists (ACL) and file system journaling.

#
# sshfs/   In computing, SSHFS (SSH Filesystem) is a filesystem client to mount
#          and interact with directories and files located on a remote server
#          or workstation.[1]  The client interacts with the remote file
#          system via the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP),[2] a network
#          protocol providing file access, file transfer, and file management
#          functionality over any reliable data stream that was designed as an
#          extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0.

#
# zfs/     ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed
#          by Sun Microsystems.  The features of ZFS include protection
#          against data corruption, support for high storage capacities,
#          integration of the concepts of filesystem and volume management,
#          snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking
#          and automatic repair, RAID-Z and native NFSv4 ACLs.
#          ...
#          Data deduplication capabilities were added to the ZFS source
#          repository at the end of October 2009, and relevant OpenSolaris
#          ZFS development packages have been available since December 3, 2009
#          (build 128).
