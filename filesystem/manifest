# Manifest for resync application
#
# To my knowledge GitHub does not support hierarchical repositories
# outside of perhaps git submodules.  However, submodules are not so
# good so I've implemented hierarchical repositories using repo names
#  and this manifest.
#
# The dashes in the repo names represent directory separation.  There
# are some repos like svn-to-git/ that have acutally dashes in the repo
# name.  Have not escaped these dashes in any way.   Might do this at
# some point.
