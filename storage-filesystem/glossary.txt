Deduplication - "In computing, data deduplication is a specialized data
  compression technique for eliminating coarse-grained redundant data,
  typically to improve storage utilization. In the deduplication process,
  duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored,
  along with references to the unique copy of data.  Deduplication is able to
  reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored."
